# ti84basic

A collection of random TI-BASIC programs I've written on my TI-84 Plus CE while I was bored in High School. I'm still in High School so I guess you can consider this repo to be in "active development".

---
Program List (*So far...*)
---
* DISCRIM - A program that calculates the discriminate (Remember, B2-4AC?) I'm sure everyone knows how to make this.
* CIRCLES - Uses the randInt() function to graph randomly sized circles at random coordinates in random colors. (Works only on CE)
* LINES - Same as circles, just with random lines of varying length instead. Also in color.
---
I have included (and will continue to include) .txt files of each source file so you can easily look over the code or "compile from source" (If you *really* want to for some reason...)

Also, for ease of editing and debugging, I reccomend using [TokenIDE](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/433/43315.html
) 
(Windows) because I'm sure we all know the pain of trying to write and especially (re)edit programs and *scroll* with those tiny two-function buttons and limited RAM and processing power.
