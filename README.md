# ti84basic

A collection of random TI-BASIC programs I've written on my TI-84 Plus CE while I was bored in High School. I'm still in High School so I guess you can consider this repo to be in "active development".

Program List
---
* DISCRIM - A program that calculates the discriminate (Remember, B2-4AC?) I'm sure everyone knows how to make this.
* CIRCLES - Uses the randInt() function to graph randomly sized circles at random coordinates in random colors. (Works only on CE)
* LINES - Same as circles, just with random lines of varying length instead. Also in color.
